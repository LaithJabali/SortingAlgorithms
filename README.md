# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This is a web application that allows you to visualize different sorting algorithms in action. You can choose the length of the array to be sorted, randomize the elements, and then watch as the sorting algorithm sorts the array step by step.

## Technologies

This project was built using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- Choose the length of the array to be sorted.
- Randomize the elements of the array.
- Visualize the array as it is sorted by the chosen sorting algorithm.
- See a visual representation of the algorithm's time complexity.
- Choose from the following sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

## Setup

To run this project locally, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Once you have these installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/LaithJabali/SortingAlgorithms.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd sorting-algorithms-visualizer`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Usage

Once you have the application running, you can use it as follows:

1. Choose the length of the array to be sorted using the slider.
2. Click the "Randomize" button to generate a new, randomized array.
3. Click the "Sort" button to start the sorting algorithm.
4. Watch as the array is sorted step by step.
